### Post-fire changes in microbiome assembly across depth in a tropical peatland
This repository contains R code to reproduce analysis presented in Bandla et al. (2023).
<p>In this study, we investigated post-fire shifts in microbiome composition across peat depth in a tropical peatland. Peat samples were collected from four plots located along a transect within the burnt and intact sites. Plots were on an average 100-150 m apart and therefore samples collected from each plot were considered as biological replicates. In each plot, peat samples were collected from three distinct depths: Surface (0-5 cm), Mid (35-40 cm), and Deep (95-100 cm).</p>
